AI for Self-Driving Car: Build a Traffic Sign Classifier

Till midterm:
So far, I have followed the week wise learning plan given by our mentor for this project. I had prior knowledge of python, so first I strengthened those concepts and then learned and practiced data handling using the pandas library. I also learned libraries such as numpy and matplotlib to get a good understanding of code. 

I then studied the core theoretical concepts of machine learning, linear regression, cost functions and gradient descent. I also explored neural networks in detail, covering both basics and advanced concepts. Currently, I have started learning convolutional neural networks (CNNs), evaluation metrics in machine learning, and their role in image based tasks, which are essential for building a traffic sign classifier. 

I have completed the initial two assignments and currently working on the final project.

Endterm:
During the endterm phase of the project, I focused on implementing and refining the complete Traffic Sign Classification system using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs). I worked with the German Traffic Sign Recognition Benchmark (GTSRB) dataset, which contains images belonging to 43 different traffic sign classes. The dataset was preprocessed by resizing all images to a uniform resolution and normalizing pixel values to improve numerical stability during training.

I designed and trained a CNN architecture consisting of multiple convolutional layers for feature extraction, followed by max-pooling layers for dimensionality reduction and dropout layers to reduce overfitting. The model was trained using categorical cross-entropy loss and the Adam optimizer. Throughout training, I monitored training and validation metrics to ensure proper convergence and generalization.

The final trained model achieved high classification accuracy on the test dataset, demonstrating the effectiveness of CNNs for image-based classification tasks in autonomous driving applications. Through this phase, I gained practical experience in model architecture design, hyperparameter tuning, evaluation metrics, and debugging deep learning pipelines.

Overall, the endterm work helped consolidate my understanding of computer vision, convolutional neural networks, and their role in self-driving car perception systems, while also strengthening my ability to independently implement and analyze machine learning models end to end.
